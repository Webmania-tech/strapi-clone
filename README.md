## General Info

---

As I want to improve my skills as a front-end developper, I decided to clone from scratch the Strapi Website. It contains a few challenges such as a responsive mega menu, animated svg's, on scroll animations, the use of Twitter API etc.

The webdesign is up-to-date and very sharp.

I decided to go for specific pages, the most challenging ones :

- [Homepage](https://strapi.io)
- [Pricing](https://strapi.io/pricing)
- [Solutions](https://strapi.io/user-stories)
- [Features overview](https://strapi.io/features)
